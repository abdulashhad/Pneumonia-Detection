This project implements a deep learning–based approach for pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images. The work focuses on binary classification of X-rays into pneumonia and normal categories using multiple neural network architectures, including a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a VGG16-based autoencoder, and a Vision Transformer (ViT). The pipeline involves image preprocessing, data augmentation, supervised training, and validation to ensure generalization. Model performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC–AUC. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning techniques for medical image classification and provides a comparative analysis of CNN-based and transformer-based models.
